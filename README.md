# Electric Current Monitor
This is a Python project developed to monitor and analyze electric current in a power grid.
The program utilizes a microcontroller connected to a current sensor to capture real-time data, enabling detection of energy leaks and tracking of electrical consumption.

## Features
Continuous monitoring of electric current in a grid.
Detection of energy leaks based on configurable limits.
Graphical visualization of electric current over time.
Flexibility to configure parameters such as sensor sensitivity, sampling rate, and detection limits.
